This article describes the hardware and software of the *Greger Client Module (GCM)*

== Hardware

The hardware of the sensor hub is made up of a https://www.raspberrypi.org/[Raspberry Pi (RPi)] with a _RPi i2c 1-Wire Expansion Module_

.RPi i2c 1-Wire Expansion Module v1.1, provided by https://www.m.nu/[m.nu]

=== 1-Wire Wiring

// Source: https://blog.m.nu/kontakteringsguide-1wire/

These wiring and contacting instructions applies to products provided by https://www.m.nu/[m.nu], except W-SERVER-ENET/WIFI and HA7Net, both from Embedded Data Systems.

To follow and understand these instructions, keep the socket with pins numbered 1-6(8) from left to right.

==== 1-Wire products with RJ12 contacting

The OW-SERVER-ENET/WIFI and HA7Net is powered on pin 6, and pin 2 is not connected. Data return and power return (GND) are shared on these products.

Smaller, cheaper... better? This needs further exploration.

== Software

=== Headless Raspberry Pi Setup

==== Step 1: Download Raspian Image

Download the latest *Lite* Raspbian Image (_Stretch_) from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/.

[quote]
The Raspbian Stretch *Lite* image is the same as the *Desktop* image but contains only the bare minimum amount of packages.

==== Step 2: Write Image to SD card

Flash the SD card, see the official https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md[Installation Instructions] available at the Raspberry Pi web page.

==== Step 3: Enable SSH on the SD card

Enable SSH by placing a file named `ssh` (without any extension) onto the boot partition of the SD card.

==== Step 4: Prepare (headless) WiFi

Create a file named `wpa_supplicant.conf` and place in the boot partition of the SD card.

This time you need to write a few lines of text for this file. For this file, you need to use the FULL VERSION of `wpa_supplicant.conf`. Meaning you must have the 3 lines of data namely ``country``, ``ctrl_interface`` and ``update_config``

.wpa_supplicant.conf
----
country="«your_ISO-3166-1_two-letter_country_code»"
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
   ssid="«your_SSID»"
   scan_ssid=1
   psk="«your_PSK»"
   key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
----

Replace ``«your_ISO-3166-1_two-letter_country_code»`` with your https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/[ISO Country Code] (such as ``SE`` for Sweden), ``«your_SSID»`` with your wireless access point name and ``«your_PSK»`` with your Wi-Fi password.

NOTE::
The password can be configured either as the ASCII representation, in quotes as per the example above, or as a pre-encrypted 32 byte hexadecimal number. https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md[See Setting up WiFi via CLI *@* www.raspberrypi.org]

==== Step 5: Power up

Insert SD card into your RPi and power up.
