This article describes the hardware and software of the *Greger Client Module (GCM)*

== Hardware

The hardware of the sensor hub is made up of a https://www.raspberrypi.org/[Raspberry Pi (RPi)] with a _RPi i2c 1-Wire Expansion Module_

.RPi i2c 1-Wire Expansion Module v1.1, provided by https://www.m.nu/[m.nu]

=== 1-Wire Wiring

// Source: https://blog.m.nu/kontakteringsguide-1wire/

These wiring and contacting instructions applies to products provided by https://www.m.nu/[m.nu], except W-SERVER-ENET/WIFI and HA7Net, both from Embedded Data Systems.

To follow and understand these instructions, keep the socket with pins numbered 1-6(8) from left to right.

==== 1-Wire products with RJ12 contacting

The OW-SERVER-ENET/WIFI and HA7Net is powered on pin 6, and pin 2 is not connected. Data return and power return (GND) are shared on these products.

Smaller, cheaper... better? This needs further exploration.

== Software
