= Greger is Grēgorios
:author: E.Sandbling

Greger is the _nordic_ version of the name Gregorius, which in turn is derived from the _latin_ form of the late Greek name "Γρηγόριος" (Grēgorios) meaning "watchful, alert" (derived from Greek "γρηγoρεῖν" "grēgorein" meaning "to watch").

In english Greger is transformed into Gregory.
